This repository contains the automated version of the paper *A troyan
Diffie-Hellman-like protocol based on proof of gullibility*, presented at
**ACDSA 2024**, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Computer,
Data Sciences and Applications

## Usage

In order to run the script, you must install
[SageMath](https://github.com/sagemath/sage). Note that if you prefer a Docker
approach, the `Dockerfile` is included in the Sagemath repository.

Once you have installed the SageMath software, the usage is straight.
```sage
$ sage script.sage
```
All the computations will be done by the software.
