# A troyan Diffie-Hellman-like protocol based on proof of gullibility

This repository contains the automated version of the paper [*A troyan
Diffie-Hellman-like protocol based on proof of
gullibility*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468029) presented at
**ACDSA 2024**, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Computer,
Data Sciences and Applications.

## Usage

In order to run the script, you must install
[SageMath](https://github.com/sagemath/sage). Note that if you prefer a Docker
approach, the `Dockerfile` is included in the Sagemath repository.

Once you have installed the SageMath software, the usage is straight.
```bash
$ sage script.sage
```
All the computations will be done by the software and will be printed in red.
